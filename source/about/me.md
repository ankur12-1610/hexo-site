Hey, I'm Ankur Patil. I graduated with Dual Degree (Bachelors + Masters) in
Mathematics and Computing from the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi. 

I'll win be joining Dream11 as Software Engineer 1 in mid-July 2025.

Currently, exploring AI (LLM oriented) and blockchain. Passionate about Software Engineering and Open Source. 

In my free time, you'll find me on the football field — or at my laptop, diving deep into system tweaks when I’m not in the mood for something productive. I also try writing blogs. (Still working on making it a habit.)
